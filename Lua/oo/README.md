Lua Class Inheritance Library
-----------------------------

Lua does not provide native support for basic object orientation or class inheritance.

By including the "classlib" module in your Lua scripts, you can emulate many of the features of both single and multiple class inheritance. 

See demo.lua for some example scripts.
